Welcome to the enriched database on biographical references related to COVID-19 created and maintained by the GE3 Research Group at the Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Cordoba (IMIBIC), Spain.

This database is part of a more ambitious project called COVIDence project, developed together with clinicians from the Reina Sofía University Hospital, Córdoba, Spain.

The original database consulted is the WHO database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We have enriched this database by manually tagging each bibliographic reference with free language terms, in order to facilitate quick and specific searches

The COVIDence project database has been created with the intention of supporting those researchers who wish to analyse scientific articles, especially to answer PICO questions asked by clinicians dealing with the COVID-2019 pandemic, that require evidence-based support for clinical decision making.

Our plan is to update it weekly.

All participants in the COVIDence project declare no conflict of interest.
