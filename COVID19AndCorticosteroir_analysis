With regard to mortality, the most robust methodology studies showed indirect evidence, based on SARS-1 and MERS, systematic review4. It suggests a publication bias that associated with the use of corticosteroids in more serious patients questions mortality outcomes. In the clinical trial on the use of dexamethasone, 52% of the causes of SDRA was pneumonia5. Analysis of the viral pneumonia subgroup of this study would be of great interest in this regard. This study shows 15% more survival at 60 days in the corticosteroid group vs control group. 

Three observational studies reported mortality/survival results. Two of them6,7 used methylprednosole (no dose or time is reported) and in another8 hydrocortisone dose equivalent 100-800 mg day (4-12 days. Average of 8 days). In study6 201 patients, 50 treated with corticosteroids mortality is 46% vs 61.8% /ID 19 52 critical patients, 26 treated with corticosteroids survival is 70% vs 50% in the corticosteroid group vs control, respectively. In study8 (244 patients, 151 corticosteroid group vs 93, control group): "corticosteroid treament was not significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality. Increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated whit elevated mortality risk. Every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisona dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk".  With regard to viral elimination three studies ID 32.50 of 72 patients take corticosteroids; in study9, 11 patients without control group; in study10,25 out of 78 patients take corticides). Methylprednisolone is used in all at doses of 0.5-1.5 mg/kg. None of them shows an increase in viral elimination time in the corticosteroid group. 

With regard to radiological improvement /clinical11 46 patients receive methylprednisolone dose 1-2 mg/kg/day for 5-7days)/ 20 do not receive it "Our data indicate that in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low- and dose-faster application corticosteroid associated with a improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus." With regard to the expert opinion articles12,13 are the ones that best discuss the opposing positions of using vs not to use corticosteroids in SARS-2 pneumonia. In conclusion At the beginning of the pandemic the recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in SARS-2 pneumonia were based on prior evidence in SARS-1 and MERS, fundamentally.
